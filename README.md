# Deep Learning
This repository contains the course projects from [ECE601 Deep Learning](https://engineering.purdue.edu/DeepLearn/) taught by [Prof. Avinash Kak](https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/) and [Prof. Charles A. Bouman](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~bouman/). I highly recommend this course to Purdue students who want to have a hands-on experience with deep learning. 

These projects guide me to have a deep understanding of the implementation of deep learning.

### OOP_Object_Oriented_Programming [[code]](https://github.com/peng-ju/Deep-Learning/blob/main/OOP_Object_Oriented_Programming.ipynb)
> A practice program for Objective Oriented Programming. Created a calllable class for Fibonacci sequence and Prime number.

### DataLoader_ImageAugmentation [[code]](https://github.com/peng-ju/Deep-Learning/blob/main/DataLoader_ImageAugmentation.ipynb)
> Created a customized Dataloader class with torch.utils.data.Dataset. Applied normalization and image augmentation. Practice with Torchvision.

### Simple_Neural_Network [[code]](https://github.com/peng-ju/Deep-Learning/blob/main/Simple_Neural_Network.ipynb)
> Constructed a two-layer neural network with Adam, SGD+ optimizer. Compared the result with Torch.nn.
