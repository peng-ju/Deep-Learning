# Deep Learning
This repository contains the course projects from [ECE601 Deep Learning](https://engineering.purdue.edu/DeepLearn/) taught by [Prof. Avinash Kak](https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/) and [Prof. Charles A. Bouman](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~bouman/). I highly recommend this course to Purdue students who want to have a hands on experience with deep learning. 

These projects guide me to have a deep understanding of the implementation of deep learning.
