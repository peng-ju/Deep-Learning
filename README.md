# Deep Learning
This repository contains the course projects from [ECE601 Deep Learning](https://engineering.purdue.edu/DeepLearn/) taught by [Prof. Avinash Kak](https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/) and [Prof. Charles A. Bouman](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~bouman/). I highly recommend this course to Purdue students who want to have a hands-on experience with deep learning. 

These projects implements the key components of the deep learning.

### OOP Object Oriented Programming [[code]](https://github.com/peng-ju/Deep-Learning/blob/main/OOP_Object_Oriented_Programming.ipynb)
> A practice program for Objective Oriented Programming. Created a calllable class for Fibonacci sequence and Prime number.

### DataLoader with Image Augmentation [[code]](https://github.com/peng-ju/Deep-Learning/blob/main/DataLoader_ImageAugmentation.ipynb)
> Created a customized Dataloader class with torch.utils.data.Dataset. Applied normalization and image augmentation. Practice with Torchvision.

### A Simple Neural Network [[code]](https://github.com/peng-ju/Deep-Learning/blob/main/Simple_Neural_Network.ipynb)
> Constructed a two-layer neural network with Adam, SGD+ optimizer. Compared the result with Torch.nn.

### Image classification with a two-layer CNN for MS-COCO dataset[[code]](https://github.com/peng-ju/Deep-Learning/blob/main/Image_classification_for_MS-COCO_Dataset.ipynb)
> Loaded 5 categories of 10000 images from the MS-COCO dataset (2014 train images). 
> Created a dataloader with image augmentation. 
> Built a classifier with a simple two-layer CNN and achieved a classification accuracy of 0.65. (Reasonable result for 64*64 images and simple CNN)
