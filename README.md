# Deep Learning
This repository contains the course projects from [ECE601 Deep Learning](https://engineering.purdue.edu/DeepLearn/) taught by [Prof. Avinash Kak](https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/) and [Prof. Charles A. Bouman](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~bouman/). I highly recommend this course to Purdue students who want to have a hands-on experience with deep learning. 

These projects guide me to have a deep understanding of the implementation of deep learning.

### DataLoader_ImageAugmentation
> Create a customized Dataloader class with torch.utils.data.Dataset. Apply normalization and image augmentation. Pratice with Torchvision.


### OOP_Object_Oriented_Programming
> Practice program for Objective Oriented Programming. Creates a calllable class for Fibonacci sequence and Prime number.
 
### Simple_Neural_Network
> Construct a two-layer neural network with Adam, SGD+ optimizer. Compared the result with Torch.nn.
